# <Challenge-1-Horiseon>

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a more organized HTML.
- This project was created so that other coders and viewers are able to understand the code more easily.
- Having a more organzied code is not only more appealing but it also is helpful if there are bugs.
- I learned which HTML tags are more useful/appropriate than other more generic tags and how they can affect your website.
